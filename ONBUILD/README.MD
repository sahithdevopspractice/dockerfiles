For Example if am trying to built a costamized image,

author of image:- I want to force users of the image to follow something

So here what we did is removed the default index.html page and asking users to have there own intex.html page, if not those who are using this image they will get error.

ONBUILD instruction will not work while building the image, it will work when other person is using this image.
